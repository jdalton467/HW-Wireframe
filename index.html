				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>This site is dedicated to information about Nikola Tesla. Tesla is responsible for many of the achievments in science and engineering that you see today. He was a pioneer in his experiments with electricity and paved the way for modern technology to emerge at a rapid pace in the 20th century. He went so far as to attempt to build the world's first ever wireless transmission tower, an idea far ahead of its time. Though he did not passaway wealthy, he left a wealth of contributions to the modern science. </p>
				<p>There will be tours this upcoming summer of Tesla's Colorado Springs labratory museum. We will keep you updated on booking info.</p>
				<p>In the meantime, please take the time to look at the galleries of Tesla's inventions, original notes, and schematics.</p>
